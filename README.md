# list2lut
This tool converts a python list to a Systemverilog LUT.

# Why?
I have worked on AES and DES enough to know that it's annoying
to write LUTs when there are perfectly good python programs here
on github. So, I solved the problem. I'll just create a python program
that converts my lists to luts.
